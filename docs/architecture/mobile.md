# Mobile app (React Native / Expo) — Plain Dharma

*Last updated: 2026-05-29*

A React Native port of the reading site, sharing the sutta content with the web
via a pnpm-monorepo workspace. Expo SDK 56 (React 19.2.3 / RN 0.85.3, New
Architecture), file-based routing with `expo-router`.

## Monorepo layout

The repo is a pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`):

```
plain-dharma/
├── src/ …                 ← the Next.js web app (still at the repo root)
├── apps/mobile/           ← the Expo app
├── packages/content/      ← shared, platform-agnostic sutta content
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml    ← packages: [apps/*, packages/*]; nodeLinker: hoisted
```

- **`nodeLinker: hoisted` is required.** React Native libraries break under pnpm's
  default isolated install (Metro/native autolinking can't resolve symlinked
  deps). It is workspace-wide — pnpm has no per-package linker — so the web also
  installs hoisted. See https://docs.expo.dev/guides/monorepos/.
- The web app has **not** been physically moved to `apps/web/` yet; that
  restructure is deferred. `next build`/dev only compile the Next app graph, so
  `apps/mobile` doesn't affect the web build, but root-level `pnpm lint`/`tsc`
  now also traverse `apps/mobile` (scope/ignore as needed), and Vercel installs
  the whole workspace (heavier install).

## `packages/content` — shared source of truth

Platform-agnostic TypeScript + the canonical `.mdx`, consumed by bundler
transpilation (no build step). Exports (`package.json` `exports` map):

| Export | Contents |
|---|---|
| `.` (`index.ts`) | `SUTTAS`, locales, `SUTTA_BASE`/`SUTTA_DISPLAY`, `getMeta`/`getNeighbors`/`getSuttasInOrder`/`isSuttaSlug`/`getAvailableLocales` |
| `./strings`, `./drops`, `./canonical-links`, `./glossary` | UI strings, editorial drops/preface/closing, Pali refs, glossary |
| `./audio` | `AudioSection`/`AudioManifest` types, `combineManifests` (pure /read stitch), `getAudioFileUrl` |
| `./en/*`, `./zh/*` | the canonical sutta `.mdx` |

What stays **web-only** (not shared, lives in `src/content`): the MDX
`LOADERS`/`loadSutta` (bundler-specific `import('*.mdx')`), the `fs`-based audio
manifest readers, and `illustrations.ts` (`fs.statSync`). As of 2026-05-29 the
content is **deduplicated** — `packages/content` is the single canonical copy
(no more parallel trees to keep in sync). The web's `src/content/index.ts` and
`audio.ts` are thin shims that `export *` from this package and add only those
web-specific pieces; the web app depends on `@plain-dharma/content`
(`workspace:*`) and Next compiles its `.mdx` via `transpilePackages`.

## Content rendering on mobile

The `.mdx` files are plain Markdown (no JSX). `babel-plugin-inline-import`
(see `apps/mobile/babel.config.js`) inlines each `.mdx` as a **raw string** at
build time; `apps/mobile/src/content/markdown.ts` imports all twelve via
**relative paths** (inline-import only resolves relative specifiers, not package
exports), strips the YAML frontmatter, and exposes `getSuttaMarkdown(locale,
slug)`. `MarkdownRenderer` renders it with `react-native-markdown-display`,
styled from the theme tokens + reading prefs (mirrors `.prose-dharma`).

## Theme + reading prefs

- `src/theme/tokens.ts` — ports `globals.css`: `PALETTE` (light/dark),
  `READING_SCALE` (sm .9 / md 1 / lg 1.15 / xl 1.35), mode-aware `CONTRAST_INK`
  + `CONTRAST_BG` (contrast recolors ink AND background — light-high → white,
  dark low/high → flat black), and `FONTS` (Garamond Libre + Atkinson
  Hyperlegible).
- `ThemeContext` — light/dark/system, persisted to AsyncStorage (`theme`) +
  system `useColorScheme`.
- `ReadingPrefsContext` — size/contrast/font, persisted to the web's
  `pd-reading-*` keys.
- Fonts loaded in `app/_layout.tsx` via `expo-font`: Garamond Libre OTFs (reused
  from the web) + Atkinson Hyperlegible (`@expo-google-fonts`, accessible toggle).
- `FloatingReadingControls` — the "Aa" popover (size / contrast / font / theme).

## Audio (`src/audio/`) — `react-native-track-player`

Requires a **custom dev build** (native module; not Expo Go). The custom entry
`apps/mobile/index.js` registers the playback service; `app.json` declares
background-audio (`UIBackgroundModes: ["audio"]`, Android foreground-service
perms).

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `manifest.ts` | Fetches a sutta's manifest from `plaindharma.com`, derives slow/fast URLs (`fast/<file>`) + durations |
| `service.ts` | Playback service — OS remote controls (lock screen, headphones) |
| `setup.ts` | Idempotent `setupPlayer` + capabilities |
| `AudioProvider.tsx` | Queue state; `load(locale, slug)` and `loadCombined(locale)` (stitched /read queue); fraction-preserving slow↔fast pace switch; **queue rebuild on source URL change** (triggers when online→offline, e.g., after download) |
| `downloads.ts` | Offline: per-language bulk download to `Paths.document`; `isLocaleDownloaded()` checks disk (manifest.json exists for each sutta), not AsyncStorage; **file/disk-based source of truth**; `resolveSuttaSections` returns local `file://` URIs when downloaded, else streams |
| `DownloadsProvider.tsx` | Offline download state + progress |

`AudioPanel` (TOC + transport + tap-to-seek + pace) and `FloatingAudioPlayer`
(the "Listen" pill, with `DownloadControl` in-player download button, `combined` prop for /read) are the UI.

### Offline download: detection and playback

**Detection** (`src/audio/downloads.ts` `isLocaleDownloaded()`) is **file/disk-based**:
- Checks whether each sutta's `manifest.json` exists on disk under `Paths.document/{locale}/`.
- Does **not** rely on an AsyncStorage flag (which didn't persist reliably).
- `downloadLocale` / `removeLocale` no longer touch AsyncStorage — they only manage files.
- This is the source of truth for "is this locale ready to play offline?"

**Playback** (`src/audio/AudioProvider.tsx`):
- `loadKey` now **always re-resolves sections and rebuilds the track-player queue** when the resolved source URL changes (e.g., a streaming queue becomes local `file://` URLs after download).
- Previously skipped rebuild on slug-only dedup, so downloaded audio didn't play offline.
- Now detects the URL change and queues the local files.

**UI entry points:**
- `DownloadControl` in `AudioPanel` (the "Listen" pill): shows "Download for offline" when locale is not downloaded, hidden once it is.
- `OfflineDownload.tsx` on the More screen: simplified label "Download for offline", per-language selector + progress bar.

### Audio → page scroll sync

`src/app/[slug].tsx` renders the sutta body as per-section `<View>`s:
- `splitSections` in `src/content/markdown.ts` splits markdown on `## ` headings into id'd sections.
- Each section's Y position is recorded via `onLayout`.
- When audio advances to a new section, `ScrollView` scrolls to that section's Y.
- Keeps the visual flow synchronized with audio playback.

## Book download & donation flow

Mirrors the web `/download` → `/download/donate` → Stripe → `/download/thank-you`
flow with native screens (`app/download/`). Donations are **optional** — the file
is always freely downloadable — and payment happens on **web Stripe Checkout**,
never in-app: Apple only permits in-app donations for registered nonprofits (which
Plain Dharma is not), so keeping the charge in the browser is the compliant path.
`@stripe/stripe-react-native` (as flexbike uses) was rejected for this reason —
better UX, but it would read as IAP circumvention for a digital good.

**Round trip** — Stripe's `success_url` must be https, so it can't target a
`mobile://` link directly:

1. `donate.tsx` POSTs `{ amount, file, platform: "mobile" }` to
   `plaindharma.com/api/checkout`; for mobile the route points success/cancel at
   `/download/return?to=thankyou|cancel&file=…`.
2. `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` opens Stripe (no auth-session consent dialog).
3. Stripe redirects to `/download/return`, a **Universal Link / App Link** — the OS
   hands the URL back to the app. `Return.tsx` also bounces a
   `mobile://download/donate?to=…` custom scheme + shows manual links as fallback.
4. `donate.tsx`'s `Linking` listener reads `to=` off whichever URL arrives,
   `dismissBrowser()` (iOS only), and routes to `thank-you` (or shows the cancelled
   banner). `thank-you.tsx` auto-delivers the file via the share sheet. The "skip
   and download for free" path calls `deliverBookFile` directly (no Stripe).

**Universal / App Link config:**
- `app.json`: `ios.associatedDomains: ["applinks:plaindharma.com"]`;
  `android.intentFilters` (`autoVerify`, host `plaindharma.com`, pathPrefix
  `/download/return`).
- Web hosts the verification files, **scoped to `/download/return*`** so the rest of
  the reading site still opens in a browser:
  - `public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` — `appID`
    `H78XB55WG8.com.plaindharma.app` (same Apple Developer team as flexbike); served
    as `application/json` via `next.config.ts` `headers()`.
  - `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` — package `com.plaindharma.app`;
    **`sha256_cert_fingerprints` is still a placeholder** (fill from the EAS Android
    keystore / Play app-signing SHA-256).
- **Reliable here because** `/download/return` is only ever hit from the app's own
  flow (web donations use `/download/thank-you`), so the app is always installed
  when the link fires.

**Operational order:** deploy the web changes first (the AASA must be live for iOS
to verify) → rebuild under `com.plaindharma.app` (native config change) → test on a
real device (simulators don't verify universal links).
`applinks:plaindharma.com?mode=developer` bypasses Apple's CDN cache during dev.

## Assets & backend

Mobile owns no audio/illustration/download files — it streams them from the
deployed `plaindharma.com`:

- Audio mp3s + manifests and illustration PNGs (`expo-image`) hit the live site.
  Book files are fetched to the cache and handed to the OS share sheet
  (`deliverBookFile` — `expo-file-system` + `expo-sharing`).
- Newsletter → `POST plaindharma.com/api/subscribe`. The general "Support" donate
  button → `expo-web-browser` to `/download/donate`. The **book-download** donate
  flow is native — see "Book download & donation flow" below.
- **Implication:** fast-mode audio, the contribute/contact routes, and any new
  content must be **deployed to production** before they work on mobile.

## App identity & icon

Configured in `apps/mobile/app.json`:

- **Name** "Plain Dharma" (home-screen label / `CFBundleDisplayName`), **slug**
  `plain-dharma`, **owner** `fotoflo`.
- **Bundle id / Android package**: `com.plaindharma.app`.
- **EAS project**: `@fotoflo/plain-dharma` (`extra.eas.projectId`). Non-interactive
  `eas` runs authenticate with the `plain-dharma` robot token — `EXPO_ROBOT_TOKEN`
  in the **repo-root** `.env.local`, exported as `EXPO_TOKEN` for the command.
- **Icon**: the web's saffron watercolor sun disc (`public/logo/mark.png`) centered
  on the `#F5EFE0` paper background, rendered to PNGs with ImageMagick (no AI).
  Variants in `assets/images/`:
  - `icon.png` (1024², flattened) — iOS (`ios.icon`) + top-level `icon` (Android
    legacy + web favicon source).
  - `android-icon-foreground.png` (disc on transparent, inside the adaptive safe
    zone) + `-background.png` (solid paper) + `-monochrome.png` (disc silhouette);
    `adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor` `#F5EFE0`.
  - `splash-icon.png` (transparent disc) + `favicon.png`; splash `backgroundColor`
    `#F5EFE0`. The old Expo `expo.icon` template bundle was removed.
- Because `ios/` is gitignored (CNG), EAS reprebuilds the icon + identity from
  `app.json` on its servers — there is no committed native copy to keep in sync.

## Build / run

Native modules (track-player, async-storage, file-system) mean **Expo Go won't
work** — use a dev build:

```
cd apps/mobile
npx expo run:ios        # prebuild + pods + simulator (first run is slow)
npx expo start --dev-client   # fast JS iteration after the first build
```

**On this Mac (Xcode 26.5):** Local `npx expo run:ios` is blocked — `xcodebuild
-showdestinations` lists no iOS Simulator destinations, only the device
placeholder with *"iOS 26.5 is not installed"* (the platform SDK component isn't
downloaded, even though the 18.6/26.3 sim runtimes are). Fix locally with
`xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS`, **or** skip it and use the EAS cloud
simulator build:**

```bash
# EXPO_TOKEN must be set (plain-dharma robot token from repo-root .env.local).
# eas.json "development" profile has ios.simulator:true → an unsigned .app for the sim.
eas build -p ios --profile development --non-interactive

# Download + install the latest build on a booted simulator and launch it, one step:
eas build:run -p ios --latest

# Fast JS iteration after install:
cd apps/mobile && expo start --dev-client
```

`scripts/audio-reencode-ab.sh` (repo root, throwaway) A/Bs lighter mp3 encodings
if download size becomes a concern (files are currently mp3 44.1 kHz mono 64 kbps).

## Gotchas

- **Inline-import needs relative paths** to the `.mdx` (not the package export),
  and must run under the app's babel config — hence `markdown.ts` lives in
  `apps/mobile/src`.
- **`@types/mdx`** (a hoisted web dep) declares `*.mdx` as an MDX component,
  colliding with the mobile string declaration; the mobile app's own TypeScript
  (6.0.3) resolves the local declaration correctly — run `tsc` from
  `apps/mobile`, not the repo root (root resolves the web's TS 5.x).
- **Decorative backgrounds** (`DecorativeBackground`) are dependency-free
  approximations (translucent discs for the light wash, static dots for the dark
  star field) — no canvas/SVG/blur deps; twinkle animation is a follow-up.
- **`<Link asChild>` rejects ARRAY `style` props** — wrap multi-style arrays in
  `StyleSheet.flatten([...])` (e.g., `apps/mobile/src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`).
- **Nothing native is runtime-verified by typecheck/bundle** — playback,
  downloads, and the tab bar need a device/simulator run.
